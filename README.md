# learn_fortran
<h3>My first steps in coding ...</h3>
<h4>and I start with Fortran and my first repository on GitHub.</h4>
<p>I've been meaning to develop a basic understanding of programming for a while now.</p>
<p>I have already tried out a few small games and programmes to learn a programming language. In this way, I have already had contact with <em>HTML</em>, <em>Java Script</em> and <em>CSS</em>.</p>
<p>I have somehow stumbled across <strong>Fortran</strong> and a tutorial. And now I write a few lines in <strong>VS Code</strong> every day.</p>
<p>In parallel, I've always been interested in what's going on in this <strong>GitHub</strong>. So I jumped in at the deep end and am now trying myself out here, <em>completely lost</em>.</p>
