# learn_fortran
My first steps in coding and I start with fortran.

It is my first repository on GitHub.

I've been meaning to develop a basic understanding of programming for a while now.
I have already tried out a few small games and programmes to learn a programming language. In this way, I have already had contact with HTML, Java Script and CSS.

Now I have somehow stumbled across Fortran and a tutorial. And now I write a few lines in VS Code every day.

In parallel, I've always been interested in what's going on in this GitHub. So I jumped in at the deep end and am now trying myself out here, completely lost.
